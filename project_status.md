### Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Container Strategy
- **Development Environment**:
  - Docker Compose for local development
  - Volume mounts for hot reloading
  - Local MongoDB container
  - Environment-specific configurations

- **Production Environment**:
  - Heroku Container Registry
  - Multi-container deployment
  - Nginx for PWA serving
  - Health checks and monitoring

#### 2. Service Architecture
- **PWA (Frontend)**:
  - Nginx-based container
  - SPA routing
  - API proxying
  - Security headers

- **API Gateway**:
  - Node.js container
  - Auth0 integration
  - Rate limiting
  - Security hardening

- **Status Service**:
  - Node.js container
  - MongoDB monitoring
  - Health checks
  - Metrics collection

#### 3. Managed Services
- **Decision**: Use managed services for core functionalities
- **Services Chosen**:
  - MongoDB Atlas for database
  - Auth0 for authentication
  - Heroku for deployment
- **Rationale**:
  - Reduced operational overhead
  - Enterprise-grade security
  - Built-in scaling and monitoring
  - Faster development cycle

#### 2. Service Architecture
- **API Gateway Service**:
  - Single entry point for all requests
  - Handles authentication and routing
  - Manages rate limiting and CORS
- **Status Service**:
  - Dedicated monitoring service
  - Aggregates system health data
  - Provides centralized status reporting

#### 3. Deployment Strategy
- **Development**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Pipeline**: Heroku Pipeline (MWAP)
  - Review Apps: Automatic from Pull Requests
  - Staging: mwap (SimpleDeploy branch)
  - Production: mwap-production (main branch)
- **Benefits**:
  - Automated review environment
  - Consistent deployment process
  - Isolated environments
  - Controlled promotion
