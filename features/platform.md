# 📈 MWAP Execution Plan: Engineering Roadmap (Expert Review)

This document outlines a world-class implementation strategy for MWAP based on current status and proposed next steps. Priorities are grouped by category with key suggestions from an expert full-stack/PWA developer.

---

## ✅ 1. Testing Infrastructure

### 🎯 Objectives
- Ensure code correctness with automated coverage.
- Enable safe and fast CI/CD deployment.

### 📦 Tools & Actions
- **Jest**: Set up unit test support for backend (service + route layers).
- **React Testing Library**: Implement for frontend UI/component testing.
- **Supertest**: API integration tests for Express routes.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI workflow with `npm test`, `lint`, `build`, and code coverage.
- **Coverage Reporting**: Use Codecov or Coveralls to monitor.

### 🧠 Pro Tips
- Mock Auth0 in tests using utilities like `nock` or `msw`.
- Add `.test.ts` files alongside core logic for readability.

---

## ✅ 2. Error Handling & Logging

### 🎯 Objectives
- Improve traceability and observability of user and system errors.

### 📦 Tools & Actions
- **Global Error Middleware**: Catch and shape all API errors consistently.
- **Custom Error Classes**: Define error types (e.g., `ValidationError`, `AuthError`).
- **Winston Logger**: Structured logs, file + console transports.
- **Sentry**: Real-time exception monitoring.
- **Request ID Tracking**: Use `uuid` per request; include in logs/responses.

### 🧠 Pro Tips
- Color-code logs in dev. Use JSON for prod shipping.
- Inject user + tenant ID into logs for auditability.

---

## ✅ 3. Security Enhancements

### 🎯 Objectives
- Harden the app and enforce best practices.

### 📦 Tools & Actions
- **Sanitization**: `express-mongo-sanitize` + `validator` for form inputs.
- **Rate Limiting**: Use `express-rate-limit` scoped to Auth0 ID or IP.
- **Field Encryption**: Use `mongoose-encryption` or `crypto` on PII fields.
- **Audit Logs**: Log sensitive actions (user edits, tenant deletions).
- **Security Headers**: Use `helmet` with strict `Content-Security-Policy`.

### 🧠 Pro Tips
- Validate all input at the API boundary.
- Record which super admin made which sensitive changes.

---

## ✅ 4. Monitoring & Performance

### 🎯 Objectives
- Gain visibility into app health and optimize bottlenecks.

### 📦 Tools & Actions
- **New Relic or Sentry Performance**: Trace performance end-to-end.
- **MongoDB Profiler**: Identify slow queries.
- **Redis**: Cache frequent, read-heavy queries.
- **Artillery/k6**: Automate stress/load testing.
- **Route Timing Logger**: Record per-route response times.

### 🧠 Pro Tips
- Auto-purge Redis keys after TTL.
- Alert on memory usage spikes, slow DB queries.

---

## ✅ 5. Code Quality & Maintainability

### 🎯 Objectives
- Enforce type safety, documentation, and clean architecture.

### 📦 Tools & Actions
- **TypeScript for Backend**: Begin migration (`ts-node-dev`, `tsconfig.json`).
- **Strict Mode**: Enable `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, etc.
- **OpenAPI / Swagger**: Autogenerate docs or write YAML manually.
- **Prettier + ESLint**: Add config + enforce via Git hooks.
- **Dependabot**: Auto-check outdated packages.

### 🧠 Pro Tips
- Add `ts-prune` + `depcheck` to find unused exports/deps.
- Use `zod` or `yup` for DTO validation.

## 🏁 Summary Recommendations

| Category               | Priority | Owner Suggestion    |
|------------------------|----------|---------------------|
| Testing Infrastructure| 🔴 High  | QA / Dev Team       |
| Error Handling & Logs | 🔴 High  | Backend Lead        |
| Security Enhancements | 🟡 Medium| DevSecOps / Backend |
| Monitoring & Perf     | 🟡 Medium| Platform Engineer   |
| Code Quality          | 🟢 Low   | Dev Lead            |

Start implementation from the top down. Track all progress in the `tenantadmin` branch or an infrastructure-focused branch.
