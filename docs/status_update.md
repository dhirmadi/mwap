# MWAP Project Status Update

## Phase 1: Feature Module Scaffolding âœ…
- [x] Created feature module folders (tenant, projects, invites, superadmin)
- [x] Added empty file stubs for routes, controllers, schemas, and types
- [x] Added health check endpoints for each feature
- [x] Registered all feature routes in main Express router

## Phase 2: Schema & Types Implementation âœ…
- [x] Tenant schema with owner reference and soft-delete
- [x] Project schema with member roles and tenant reference
- [x] InviteCode schema with expiry and single-use tracking
- [x] SuperAdmin schema for system-wide access
- [x] Added proper indexes for performance
- [x] Implemented type-safe interfaces and models

## Phase 3: API Routes & Controllers âœ…
- [x] Tenant routes for creation and management
- [x] Project routes with role-based access control
- [x] Invite generation and redemption endpoints
- [x] Member management routes with role hierarchy
- [x] SuperAdmin routes for global access
- [x] Added shared middleware and auth types

## Phase 4: Business Logic Implementation ðŸš§
- [ ] Tenant creation with ownership validation
- [ ] Invite code redemption with expiry checks
- [ ] Role update/removal with hierarchy enforcement
- [ ] Soft-delete implementation for projects/tenants
- [ ] Project filtering by access and archive state

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 4 implementation tasks
2. Add integration tests for all endpoints
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Document API usage and examples

## Technical Stack
- Express.js with TypeScript
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Auth0 for authentication
- Zod for validation
- Jest for testing (planned)

## Architecture
- Modular feature-based structure
- Clean separation of concerns:
  * Routes: Request handling and validation
  * Controllers: Business logic
  * Schemas: Data models and validation
  * Types: TypeScript interfaces and enums
- Shared middleware for auth and access control
- Role-based permission system
- Soft-delete pattern for data retention

## Security Measures
- Auth0 integration for secure authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation with Zod
- Proper error handling and status codes
- No direct DB deletions (soft-delete only)
- Rate limiting (planned)

## Known Issues
None at this time.

## Upcoming Features
1. User profile management
2. Project activity logs
3. Team collaboration features
4. Advanced search and filtering
5. Analytics dashboard for admins
